Here’s the **detailed AI prompt** you can give to an agent to recreate that **mobile view submenu design** you showed:

---

**Prompt:**
"Create a mobile-friendly version of the navbar’s sub-section (dropdown menu) similar to the RegisterKaro mobile UI.

**Requirements:**

1. **Layout & Structure:**

   * Full-height vertical sliding panel from the left or right when a main navbar item (e.g., 'Registrations') is clicked.
   * The panel width should be around `85%` of the viewport width, with the remaining area dimmed for focus.
   * Sticky top header inside the panel showing:

     * A back arrow icon (`<`) on the left to return to the main menu.
     * The section title in bold (e.g., 'Registrations') centered.

2. **Content Style:**

   * Each sub-section should have a **bold heading** (e.g., 'Company Registration').
   * Below the heading, display a list of links (e.g., 'Private Limited Company Registration', 'LLP Registration', etc.)
   * Use bullet points (`•`) or small icons before each item.
   * Links should have no underline but change color slightly on hover/tap for visual feedback.

3. **Typography & Colors:**

   * Heading: font-weight bold, color `#1c2431`, slightly larger font size (\~1.1rem).
   * List items: normal weight, color `#1c2431`, font size \~0.95rem.
   * Background: white (`#fff`).
   * Back arrow icon and title: dark navy (`#1c2431`).

4. **Spacing & Dividers:**

   * Use enough padding for touch targets: `padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem`.
   * Add a subtle horizontal divider (`#e5e5e5`) between main groups.

5. **Behavior:**

   * Smooth slide-in animation (0.3s ease-in-out).
   * Back arrow should close the sub-section and return to the main navbar list.
   * The menu should be scrollable if the list exceeds the viewport height.

6. **Extra Details:**

   * At the bottom right corner, display a small floating circular support/expert image (as in the reference screenshot).
   * Make it fully responsive for mobile devices (320px - 768px width).
   * Ensure accessibility: proper ARIA roles for navigation menus.

This should replicate the exact mobile sub-section style and behavior seen in the provided screenshot while keeping the UI clean and touch-friendly."

If you want, I can now **code this mobile view sub-section** so you can plug it directly into your navbar system. That way, it will match both desktop and mobile designs seamlessly.
